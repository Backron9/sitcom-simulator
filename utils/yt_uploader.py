# NOT IMPLEMENTED
# the legacy version of this app uploaded to YT
# but the videos get auto-set to private
# so I removed that functionality temporarily. Stay tuned.

# all the commented sections below are auto-generated YouTube thumbnails and descriptions
# it works, but the youtube api restricts videos,
# so I've temporarily disabled this functionality
# while figuring out a better system

# generate description
# temporarily disabled
# description = generate_description(video_title)
# yt forces the video to be private. Looking into it.
# upload_to_yt(f"./renders/{video_title}.mp4", video_title, description, keywords, privacyStatus="public")
# file1 = open(f"./renders/{video_title}/description.txt", "w")  # append mode
# file1.write(description)
# file1.close()

# generate thumbnail for youtube
# temporarily disabled
# generate_image(f'{video_title} youtube centered clickbait', f'./renders/{video_title}/thumbnail', quality=args.img_quality, width=512, height=512)
